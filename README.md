## 🔑 Key Features

**Task Organization and Tracking**
   - You can create a "sticky note" by clicking the plus button and selecting a color
   - You can pause, start, edit, finish, or delete a task with the respective buttons
   - After clicking the edit button, you give the task a name, topic, due date, and estimated time to complete
   - When you click the start button, the break timer and blocking system will automatically start
     
**Calendar**
   - Along with tracking tasks in the normal bulletin board view, you can also switch to the calendar view and see the du dates of all your tasks for the month
   - In this view, you can also drag tasks to different days to change the due date of the task
     
**Blocking and Breaks**
   - When you start a task, an AI blocking algorithm will decide which searches and webpages are related to your assignment and block them accordingly
   - If you select "take breaks", Boxly will automatically give you forced breaks that block anything from being done on your browser

**🗻 Challenges**

Currently, there are still some issues with Boxly. We have started the implementations for an "artboards" feature (top right of the home page). We did not have enough time to complete this feature in this version of Boxly but we will do it for future versions. While working on the project, we did have some problems with scaling the website for different screen sizes. Although it isn't perfect, we tried our best and the end result is aesthetically solid. We also had some trouble with getting the blocking algorithm to be accurate. After a lot of testing and training, we have got the algorithm to be pretty accurate which is something we are proud of.
